# Monopoly

Monopoly is a classic game in which you can buy, rent and sell your property! This is a game that everyone played. At the beginning of the game, the participants place their chips on the start field, then move them around the playing field, depending on the number of points scored on the dice. Depending on which site you hit, certain actions are available to you. And now, thanks to our development team, this game, already loved by many people, will become available not only like a board game.
